# Brainf*** compiler written in Go
Cordially known as brainfrick, because swear words are uncouth.

This program was more a proof of concept, not meant to practically compile brainfrick. For that purpose, many others 
have written cleaner and more efficient algorithms.

In `main.go`, the variable `testFileName` is the name of the file in the `test` folder that is being compiled. 
In that folder, I provided 3 files for testing purposes:
* `helloWorld.bf` is a Hello World program (this is the default program in `main.go`)
* `echo.bf` simply mimics the "echo" Linux command
* `yourcode.bf` is provided for you to write your own program

Feel free to add additional programs as you see fit.
